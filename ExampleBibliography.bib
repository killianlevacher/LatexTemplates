@article{Tao2010,
abstract = {The ability to answer temporal-oriented questions based on clinical narratives is essential to clinical research. The temporal dimension in medical data analysis enables clinical researches on many areas, such as, disease progress, individualized treatment, and decision support. The Semantic Web provides a suitable environment to represent the temporal dimension of the clinical data and reason about them. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic-Web based framework, which provides an API for querying temporal information from clinical narratives. The framework is centered by an OWL ontology called CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology), and contains three major components: time normalizer, SWRL based reasoner, and OWL-DL based reasoner. We also discuss how we adopted these three components in the clinical domain, their limitations, as well as extensions that we found necessary or desirable to archive the purposes of querying time-oriented data from real-world clinical narratives.},

abstract = {Twitter provides access to large volumes of data in real time, but is notoriously noisy, hampering its utility for NLP. In this paper, we target out-of-vocabulary words in short text messages and propose a method for identifying and normalising ill-formed words. Our method uses a classifier to detect ill-formed words, and generates correction candidates based on morphophonemic similarity. Both word similarity and context are then exploited to select the most probable correction candidate for the word. The proposed method doesnt require any annotations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over an SMS corpus and a novel dataset based on Twitter.},

@misc{Masud2010,
abstract = {The problem of data stream classification is challenging because of many practical aspects associated with efficient processing and temporal behavior of the stream. Two such well studied aspects are infinite length and concept-drift. Since a data stream may be considered a continuous process, which is theoretically infinite in length, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Data streams also frequently experience concept-drift as a result of changes in the underlying concepts. However, another important characteristic of data streams, namely, concept-evolution is rarely addressed in the literature. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream. This paper addresses concept-evolution in addition to the existing challenges of infinite-length and concept-drift. In this paper, the concept-evolution phenomenon is studied, and the insights are used to construct superior novel class detection techniques. First, we propose an adaptive threshold for outlier detection, which is a vital part of novel class detection. Second, we propose a probabilistic approach for novel class detection using discrete Gini Coefficient, and prove its effectiveness both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we address the issue of simultaneous multiple novel class occurrence, and provide an elegant solution to detect more than one novel classes at the same time. We also consider feature-evolution in text data streams, which occurs because new features (i.e., words) evolve in the stream. Comparison with state-of-the-art data stream classification techniques establishes the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to discourse analysis within information extraction systems. It makes use of DRT as formal representation of the linguistic context as well as of a domain-specific ontology as a basis to compute conceptual relations between extracted events thus establishing discourse coherence. The approach has been implemented within GenIE, an information extraction system with the aim of extracting information about biochemical pathways, about sequences, structures and functions of genomes and proteins. The approach is evaluated against a semantically hand-annotated set of Swiss-Prot protein function descriptions and shows very promising results.},

The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-ner system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-ner leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms co-training, increasing F1 by 25\% over ten common entity types. Our NLP tools are available at: http://github.com/aritter/twitter\_nlp},
